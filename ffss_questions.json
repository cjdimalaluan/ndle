Too much salt inhibits yeast, leading to low volume. Short proofing time doesn't allow enough gas production. Over-kneading breaks down the gluten structure. Too little salt can cause the dough to be sticky and the gluten to collapse from over-proofing, but among the choices, it's the least direct cause of a lack of rising volume compared to the others which directly impede it.", "tags": [] },
